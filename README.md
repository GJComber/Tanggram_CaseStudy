## Overview and Origin 


The innovation of Tanggram began in Aug 2016, when it was founded by Nick Tang  who was joined by co-founders Derek Li, Connie Ren and Demi Xu.
 It is part of the Evertang Group. Tanngram was registered in March 2018. They launched the beta version of its app in the second half of 2019, ahead of the official launch in April 2020. 


The idea for Tanggram came about because there were difficulties with accessing financial services particularly for younger investors. The service fee was too high, the paperwork was too complicated, and the application process was taking too long etc. As they developed their solutions the demographic of their clients had changed over time. More and more young people needed support to manage their wealth. There was a need to solve these existing problems with innovative technologies. This was the original intention of building Tanggram. 

   They produced some attractive and solid packaged fund options. 
 with an aim to deliver reliable returns while effectively managing the risks. They give access to Australian investment options that were only available to
institutional investors, in the past.

 ## Funding
 
  

Tanngram has raised $3.9m  AUD in Angel and Seed investors with a further $5m AUD in a Series A capital raising, led by the Raye family, along with other boutique investors, to create a unique product, further develop the platform and scale up in the market.

## Business Activities 
 

As a member of Fintech Australia, Tanggram is aiming to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of financial services through technology and an innovative business model, opening up the market to Millenials 

 The product they have developed is Australia’s first personal wealth app that allows people to ‘invest while shopping’. 

 To access the investment options, interested users can download the app which partners with more than 500 merchants, including food & drink, beauty, entertainment, education, sports and grocery merchants, through which they can access deals and rewards. Every time users participate and shop, they receive shopping rewards (called T-Points) which are equivalent to $1 each and can then be invested by contributing towards the cost of the managed investment packages on offer.

The aim is to introduce younger generations to investing through points gained via online shopping deals, and simple and reliable investment options through two of Australia’s leading financial management funds: La Trobe Financial, which has $12 billion in assets under management; and Trilogy, which specialises in property-based investments. 

Tanggram built their solution on their own. The often time consuming & costly manual paperwork processes have all been integrated into their App in order to make investment easy for their users. 

Tanggram have also developed an online library with a range of articles and links to assist people to grow and expand their knowledge and financial confidence. This resource also helps to keep their clients informed and confident about their money and financial status. 

Their target market are typically in their early-30s to mid-40s, are employed, have a solid savings base and on average earn about $60,000 to $80,000. 
 

Millennials are the largest and the most educated demographic group, they are tech savvy and prefer to do everything online rather than face-to-face.
 
Born between 1981 and 1996 and numbering over 75 million, millennials have become the largest demographic group in the US, according to the Brookings Institution. 

Millennials are better educated than any other group and are entering their prime earning years.This presents a huge opportunity for forward- thinking Fintech firms to gain marketshare

## Landscape 

 Tanngram is in the Wealth Management sector as a Fintech startup

 Traditional paths and methods are becomiing limiting and will eventually be a small sector of the industry
 
 The sector has seen a transformation towards digital products. Faster easier mobile solutions.

Deloittes recently published an article that demonstrates the transformation.
*Building a new, scalable digital architecture*

*In our 2017 paper, we outlined a functional architecture for a scalable wealth management platform that would enable the digital adviser of the future. We have reviewed this functional architecture with more than 50 wealth managers and a number of industry vendors in North America, Europe, and Asia, and have found it to be a reliable guide for the future. In the last 18 months, a number of these firms have focused their investments on a small set of core capabilities, with the following five standing out the most:*
* New client digital solutions. 

* Broker-dealers’ new digital applications launches. 

* State-of-the-art CRM capabilities. 

* Modern data management (MDM) capabilities. 

* Streamlined on-boarding solutions. 

*These capabilities have not only shortened time to bottom line impact, but have created positive dynamics with clients, advisors, and shareholders, likely spurring further transformation for years to come.* 
 
 
Many of the encumbents in this domain are working towards developing the tech to remain relevant and those who succeed will continue to be a force in the industry.

Some examples are:  

**Westpac Bank BT Invest** and
**TPT Wealth**
who have both developed low entry price, quick easy join, mobile based products 

A Startup in this domain that has been around for some years now is 
**Betterment:**

It was founded in 2008 in New York, NY
with 
funding of $435M (Debt Financing)

 Having in excess of $21B under management, it’s also one of the larger retirement account companies. They also provide the required regulatory documentation in the app.  Betterment has helped open up financial planning to everyday smartphone users, allowing a diversified selection of equity and bond choices for different age groups and risk tolerances.

 It would be a good benchmark for Tanngram to guage its success by, in the coming years.

## Results 

 
Tanngram has under 25 employees and makes under $1m p.a. profits currently, but these have approximately doubled  each financial year in the first two years which is promising 


Customers have earnt over $1m in rewards points to go towards their investments which demonstrates the potential for this market strategy 

It is expected that wealthtech startups will develop an increasing marketshare, as the millennials continue to control more and more of the economy.

There is a  similarity between all of these innovative money management startups. It is that they’re smooth, intuitive for the digitally native consumer, and feature sleek branding and a great user experience while being mobile-friendly.

## Some key Metrics

Wealth Management firms use funds under management as the key metric.
Other metrics include acquisition, profitability and marketing value.

Since its official launch in April 2020, the platform has  accumulated $10 million in funds under management. They have reported attracting some 70,000 users and all without any marketing spend. Not huge figures but relatively strong for their size and time in the market.

## Recommendations 


 If I was to advise Tanggram, I would suggest a payments platform that can be used for purchasing the products that earn points. This could be expanded to earn tiered points depending on products bought with it.
 I believe it would expand the shopping and points benefits to customers, leading to more providers on boarding whilst developing a second income stream for Tanggram. Given that it could grow the business with little advertising spend, it is in keeping with their business model at these early stages.
 
Developing their own payments platform would require
Code development, cloud database, distributed ledger and possibly blockchain technology to be utilised

 Some of elements of these technologies are already incorporated in Tanggram's set-up which was primarily built in house.
